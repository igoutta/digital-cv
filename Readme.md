## ✈️ Engineering Experience

**Mechatronics Lab Assistant** @ [ROBIOTEC](https://robiotec.ec/) *(Apr 2023 - Present)* <br>
Early-stage branch of multinational company focused on drone testing and development.

- Testing of large electric-powered UAV, that involved GNSS overhaul, new connection system to also new radiotransmitter and adaptation of our geolocation software to allows new drones IDs.
- Participation in the unsupervised flight mission of a drone, distance record, between two points.
- Early-stage development of the communication system between MAVLink drone protocol and Robiot system, under Python. It started with PyMAVLink library and later changed to MAVSDK, which benefits from  easier device communication and asynchronization.
- Collaboration in the development of an Hybrid VTOL airframe, making use of Autodesk CFD simulations in order to improve the laminar airflow between wings.
- Development and deployment of mill power monitoring HMI system with data storage, under Node-RED. Data was collected from Modbus TCP in Siemens Sentron devices, which were previously tested and configured for a subnet with a Linux mainframe PC used as a gateway.
- ***Software Technologies used:*** Python, Javascript, Node-RED, Sqlite, Arduino C, MAVLink, Linux Enviroment, Shell.
- ***Enginnering Technologies used:*** Ardupilot, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk CFD.
- ***Hardware Technologies used:*** Modbus, ESC, drone controllers, underwated propulsion motors, radiotransmitters.

**Mechatronics Trainee** @ [ROBIOTEC](https://robiotec.ec/) *(Oct 2022 - Mar 2023)* <br>
Early-stage branch of multinational company focused on drone testing and development.

- Early development of Geolocation software under Node-RED. With the Iridium SBD system redirected to an webhook, the software obtains the data string that after processing is displayed as the drone position on a map, the height in a chart, and speed and battery charge in widgets.
- Learning of electric-powered UAV functioning, which involved the understanding the main configuration of the control system under Ardupilot firmware parameters, the VTOL system and ESC's calibration.
- Geolocation software data storing under relational database schema and the display in historial tab.
- Testing of geolocation software with an large automated UAV mission flight in Azuay.
- Research on underwater propulsion systems.
- Early-stage development and testing of an USV control system using Ardupilot firmware.
- Frontend development of an area selector on image with a color selector. The app, developed in PyQt5, connects my visual color selector with the color recognition software and shows the image output.
- ***Software Technologies used:*** Python, Qt5, Javascript, CSS, Node-RED, Sqlite, Arduino C, Ardupilot.
- ***Hardware Technologies used:*** DC three-phase brushless motors, ESC, Arduino.
